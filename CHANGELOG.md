## v0.10.0 — *Fair Hand* · Jun 14, 2026

A legibility and restraint pass across the whole interface. The pixel font stays where it belongs (the village, the brand), and the data you actually read gets a clear hand.

- **Two-face type system** — `Press Start 2P` is now the display/brand face only; a new self-hosted companion, **Departure Mono**, carries all dense data (panel values, tool history, messages, dashboard card bodies, the agent list). A fixed type scale enforces a 10px floor, so nothing renders sub-legible anymore
- **Design-token foundation** — shared surface, elevation, spacing, divider, and focus-ring tokens in `reset.css`; a single global focus ring replaces the inconsistent per-control styles
- **Lighter chrome** — removed the duplicated second decoration pass ("refinement layer" blocks) that every surface carried; topbar, sidebar, dashboard cards, and the activity panel now use one consistent, token-driven treatment
- **Activity panel rebuilt** — leads with one plain-language line of what the agent is doing; the rest of the journey (route, reservation, breadcrumb, goal) moves into a collapsed "More detail" disclosure. Redundant rows removed, consecutive-duplicate breadcrumbs collapsed, and raw reason codes suppressed. Meta and token cells use compact `label · value` rows
- **Topbar tiered** — one unified chip style; status badges read as primary, with FPS and version quieted into a calm tertiary cluster
- **Sidebar** — a live filter input plus collapsible grouping of workflow subagents (collapsed by default), and a far more legible agent list
- **Minimap removed** — the parchment overlay is gone; pan and zoom are unchanged, and the per-frame draw returns canvas budget
- **Toasts** no longer overlap the open activity panel

---

## v0.9.1 — *The Chronicle* · Jun 11, 2026

The village gets a memory. Click the version chip to browse the full history.

- **In-app changelog viewer** — `GET /api/changelog` serves `CHANGELOG.md`; clicking the version chip opens a wide modal with styled release headers, named entries, and dimmed hotfix rows
- **Markdown renderer** — inline parser in `TopBar` converts the changelog format to HTML (version chip, release name, date, bullet lists, bold/italic/code)
- **Version bumped** — `index.html` and `package.json` corrected from v0.1 to v0.9 to reflect actual project history
- **Agent docs** — `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` updated with a `## Changelog` section instructing agents to prepend an entry and update version locations before pushing

---

## v0.9.0 — *Swift Roads* · Jun 11, 2026
